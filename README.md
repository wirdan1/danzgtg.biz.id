Welcome to my **personal portfolio website**! This project is built with **Next.js** and designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in a sleek and modern way. I've decided to open-source this project to help other developers create their own stunning portfolios. Feel free to explore, customize, and use it as a template for your own projects! ✨
